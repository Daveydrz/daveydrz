Inner Monologue - Background Consciousness Stream

This module implements continuous inner thought processes that:
- Generates scheduled internal thoughts and self-talk
- Maintains background consciousness stream during idle periods
- Creates dream-like states and spontaneous insights
- Enables self-reflection and internal questioning
- Produces spontaneous insight generation and creative thoughts
